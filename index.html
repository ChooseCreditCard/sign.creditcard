    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean to “Sign” for a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        Signing up for a credit card used to involve a handwritten signature on paper; today it is mostly done with
        digital consent – ticking boxes, confirming via app, SMS codes or e-ID. In all cases, you are entering into a
        binding agreement with an issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The agreement covers interest, fees, repayment obligations, how your data is used and what happens if you fall
        behind. The marketing page might highlight rewards and welcome offers; the signed contract spells out the full
        terms behind them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>From Application to Signature – Step by Step</h2>
      <p>
        A typical sign-up process follows a familiar pattern:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>• You submit an application with personal and financial information.</li>
        <li>• The issuer assesses credit risk using internal rules and external data.</li>
        <li>• If approved, you are shown the card’s key terms and full agreement.</li>
        <li>• You provide a digital signature or strong authentication to accept.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The “signature” step is where the offer turns into a contract. Once accepted, the issuer can open the account,
        produce the card and start reporting activity according to local rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Welcome offers -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Sign-Up Bonuses, Welcome Offers and Small Print</h2>
      <p>
        Many cards use sign-up bonuses to attract new customers: extra points, miles, cashback or reduced fees if you
        spend a certain amount within a time window. These incentives are optional marketing layers on top of the
        underlying agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The details matter: qualifying purchases, excluded categories, deadlines, caps and clawback rules if the account
        is closed early. Reading the welcome offer terms before signing helps avoid disappointment or unexpected charges.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Digital signatures & security -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Digital Signatures, Strong Authentication & Security</h2>
      <p>
        When you sign digitally, the issuer must be confident that the person accepting the terms is really you. This is
        why many sign-up flows use multi-factor checks – codes via SMS or app, digital ID systems or bank logins – in
        addition to a simple tick box.
      </p>
      <p>
        These mechanisms help create an auditable trail that the issuer can point to as proof of consent. For you, they
        reduce the likelihood of someone else opening an account in your name without additional verification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- After signing -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What Changes After You Have Signed?</h2>
      <p>
        After you sign, the new account becomes part of your overall credit profile. Limits, utilisation, payment
        behaviour and missed due dates can all influence how future applications are viewed, whether with the same
        issuer or others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some cards invite you to activate additional services after sign-up – instalment plans, extra cards, insurance
        add-ons or higher limits. These features may be governed by separate consents and documents, even though they sit
        under the same account.
